# tfjs-examples
Learn tensorflow.js and create new state of the art models that can work on browser.

The beginner activities are updated version of some great tutorials. You can see the original code samples for

1. **Simple Regression:** Laurence Moroney's introduction videos for coding with Tensorflow.js are great materials if you are new to coding with Javascript and Tensorflow. [Go to this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J72iMSQmy8)

2. **Linear and Polynomial Regression:** Machine learning problems can be categorized to two: Regression and Classification. This example originally introduced in [Tensorflow's Codelab Tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tfjs-training-regression/index.html#0).

3. **Introducing Non-Linearity:** Implementing a simple XOR function and define a neural network from scratch can help us to understand the logic behind all operations in neural network structures. This code is originally introduced in [Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train Video - Multilayer Perceptron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5GAVdLQyIg) You will see the flavor of Dan's Coding Train in everywhere of this repo. It is a great source and inspiration to learn more about this subject field.
